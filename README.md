# Java Encryption-Decryption Tool

A simple Java-based command-line application that allows users to **encrypt** and **decrypt** messages using two techniques:

- **Simple Encryption/Decryption** (Shift Cipher)
- **Reverse Encryption/Decryption** (Shift Cipher + Reversal)

---

## 📌 Features

- Encrypt and decrypt messages using a shift cipher (Caesar cipher-like logic)
- Support for both **letters** and **numbers**
- Reverse mode: encrypts and reverses the message for added complexity
- Input validation to ensure key is a positive integer
- Simple CLI menu for interaction

---
