# Java Encryption-Decryption Tool

A simple Java-based command-line application that allows users to **encrypt** and **decrypt** messages using two techniques:

- **Simple Encryption/Decryption** (Shift Cipher)
- **Reverse Encryption/Decryption** (Shift Cipher + Reversal)

---

## 📌 Features

- Encrypt and decrypt messages using a shift cipher (Caesar cipher-like logic)
- Support for both **letters** and **numbers**
- Reverse mode: encrypts and reverses the message for added complexity
- Input validation to ensure key is a positive integer
- Simple CLI menu for interaction

---

## 🚀 How to Run

### Prerequisites

- Java 8 or higher
- Command-line interface (Terminal or Command Prompt)

### Steps

1. **Clone or Download** this repository.
2. Save the code in a file named `Encryption_Decryption.java`
3. Open terminal and navigate to the file directory.
4. Compile the code:
   javac Encryption_Decryption.java
5. Run the code:
   java Encryption_Decryption

## 🧠 How It Works
Simple Encryption
Shifts alphabetic characters by key % 26

Shifts numeric characters by key % 10

Reverse Encryption
Same as simple encryption

Then reverses the encrypted message

Decryption
Reverses the steps based on the method (Simple or Reverse)
